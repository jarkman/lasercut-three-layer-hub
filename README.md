# lasercut-three-layer-hub

This is a simple hub for fitting lasercut parts (cogs & cams) to 4mm shafts.

It's designed to be lasercut from 3mm acetal. It might work in other materials but I have not tested it.

It uses M3 nuts & bolts, including one square M3 nut for the clamp bolt.

Note that the two top bolts (the ones near the clamp bolt) have to be loosened a bit 
while the clamp bolt is tightened, to allow the clamp action to happen. That's why those holes are oversize.

The Fusion360 file in the design is moderately parametric, it should be easy to adjust
for other shaft and bolt diameters. DXFs are included for 4, 5,and 6mm shafts.
